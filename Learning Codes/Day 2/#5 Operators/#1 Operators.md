**What is an operator?** <br>
An operator is a symbol used to perform operations in a given programming language. <br>

**Types of Operators in C Language** <br>
1. _Arithmetic Operators_: are used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction etc. Few of the simple arithmetic operators are :

|Operator | Description |
|:-------:|:-----------:|
|+ | Addition |
|âˆ’ | Subtraction |
|* | Multiplication |
|/ | Division |
|% | Modulus |

We all know their purpose and how they are used in simple mathematics.

2. _Relational Operators_: are used for the comparison between two or more numbers. Same as Java, C also has six relational operators and their return value is in Boolean i.e. either True or False (1 or 0)

|Operator | Description |
|:-------:|:-----------:|
|> | Greater than |
|< | Less than |
|>= | Greater than or equal to |
|<= | Less than or equal to |
|== | Is equal to |
|!= | Is not equal to |

3. _Logical Operators_: There are three logical operators i.e. AND, OR and NOT. They can be used to compare Boolean values but are mostly used to compare conditions to see whether they are satisfying or not <br>

_AND_: it returns true when both operators are true or 1.

_OR_: it returns true when either operator is true or 1.

_Not_: it is used to reverse the logical state of the operand.

|Symbol | Operator |
|:-----:|:--------:|
|&& | AND operator |
|2 Vertical Bars | OR Operator |
|! | NOT Operator |

4. _Bitwise Operators_: To perform bit level operations, bitwise operators are used. They convert the values we provide to them in binary format and then compare them to provide us the results <br>

|Symbols | Operators |
|:------:|:---------:|
|& | Bitwise AND |
|Vertical Bar | Bitwise OR |
|^ | Bitwise XOR |
|~ | Bitwise complement |
|<< | Shift left |
|>> | Shift right|

5. _Assignment Operators_: They are used to assign values. They are going to be used in each and every one of our program <br>

|Operator | Description |
|:-------:|:-----------:|
|= | Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand |
|+= | It adds the right operand to the left operand and assign the result to the left operand |
|-= | It subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand |
|*= | It multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand |
|/= | It divides the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand |
