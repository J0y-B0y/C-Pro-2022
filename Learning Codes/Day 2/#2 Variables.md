**What is a Variable?** <br>
It is a name given to a memory location <br>

Declared by writing ```type variable_name;``` <br>
Example: ```int a;```, here we are declaring a variable _a_ of type _int_ <br>
Example 2: ```int a, b;```, here we are declaring 2 variables _a, b_ of type _int_<br>

Initialized and declared by ```type variable_name = value;``` <br>
Example: ```int a = 4;```, here we command the compiler to reserve a place for _a_ in the memory and put the value of _4_ in it. <br>
Alternative way: <br>
```
int a;
a = 4;
```
**Variable Nomenclature**
A variable name can be of anything we want to call out variable. Yet there are specific rules we must follow while naming a variable:

> A variable name can contain alphabets, digits, and underscore (-) only <br>
The starting letter can not be a digit <br>
White spaces cannot be used <br>
The name should not be reserved keyword or special character <br>
